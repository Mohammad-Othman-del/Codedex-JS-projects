# JavaScript Fun Projects

This repository contains two JavaScript projects created for fun and learning purposes.  
They were part of my practice journey: a checkpoint project to experiment with logic and syntax,  
and a final project where I combined what I learned into a more complete application.

---

## Projects

### 1. Checkpoint Project – Horoscope & Fortune Teller
**Description:**  
A simple JavaScript program that assigns a zodiac sign and symbol based on a given birth month,  
and then randomly generates fortunes from a list of motivational predictions.

**Features:**
- Uses a `switch` statement for readability.
- Randomly selects multiple fortunes from an array.
- Output is printed in the console.

```js
let birthMonth = "July";
// Outputs zodiac sign, symbol, and 5 random fortunes
````

### 2. Final Project – Pomodoro Timer

**Description:**
A Pomodoro app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It lets you start a timed focus session, displays a countdown, and plays a bell sound when the session ends.

**Features:**

* Countdown timer with minutes and seconds.
* Plays a notification sound (`bell.wav`) when time is up.
* Prevents starting multiple overlapping sessions.
* Styled with a gradient background and circular timer design.

**Preview:**

* `index.html` – Structure of the app.
* `style.css` – Styling of the timer UI.
* `app.js` – Core logic for the timer.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-fun-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd js-fun-projects
   ```
3. Open the files in your browser:

   * For the checkpoint project, open the console to see fortunes.
   * For the Pomodoro app, open `index.html` in a browser.

---

## Notes

* These projects are not production-level apps — they are meant for practice, experimentation, and fun.
* The fortune messages were generated using ChatGPT.
* The Pomodoro app can be extended (for example: adding pause/reset, session/break cycles).

## Purpose

This repo documents my learning progress in JavaScript:
from basic logic building (checkpoint project) to building a small functional app (final project).
