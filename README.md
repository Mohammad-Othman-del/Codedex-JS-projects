# JavaScript Fun Projects 🎉

This repository contains **two JavaScript projects** created for **fun and learning purposes**.  
They were part of my practice journey: a **checkpoint project** to experiment with logic and syntax,  
and a **final project** where I combined what I learned into a more complete application.

---

## 📌 Projects

### 1. Checkpoint Project – Horoscope & Fortune Teller 🔮
- **Description:**  
  A simple JavaScript program that assigns a zodiac sign and symbol based on a given birth month,  
  and then randomly generates fortunes from a list of motivational predictions.
- **Features:**
  - Uses a `switch` statement for readability.
  - Randomly selects multiple fortunes from an array.
  - Output is printed in the console.

```js
let birthMonth = "July";
// Outputs zodiac sign, symbol, and 5 random fortunes
````

### 2. Final Project – Pomodoro Timer ⏳

* **Description:**
  A **Pomodoro app** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  It lets you start a timed focus session, displays a countdown, and plays a bell sound when the session ends.
* **Features:**

  * Countdown timer with minutes and seconds.
  * Play notification sound (`bell.wav`) when time is up.
  * Prevents starting multiple overlapping sessions.
  * Styled with a minimal gradient background and circular timer design.

**Preview:**

* `index.html` – Structure of the app.
* `style.css` – Styling of the timer UI.
* `app.js` – Core logic for the timer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-fun-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd js-fun-projects
   ```
3. Open the files in your browser:

   * For the **checkpoint project**, open the console to see fortunes.
   * For the **Pomodoro app**, open `index.html` in a browser.

---

## 📝 Notes

* These projects are **not production-level apps** — they are meant for **practice, experimentation, and fun**.
* The fortune messages were generated using ChatGPT.
* The Pomodoro app can be extended (e.g., adding pause/reset, session/break cycles).

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo documents my **learning progress in JavaScript**:
from **basic logic building** (checkpoint project) to **building a small functional app** (final project).
